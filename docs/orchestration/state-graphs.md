# State Graphs

State graphs are a declarative way to define multi-step workflows as YAML tool files. Instead of writing Python or orchestrating LLM threads, you define a graph of nodes and edges — the runtime walks the graph, executes actions at each node, and routes to the next node based on conditions. No code, no LLM reasoning — just data-driven execution.

## Core Concept

A state graph is a YAML tool file with `tool_type: graph` and `executor_id: rye/core/runtimes/state-graph/runtime`. The runtime reads the graph definition, starts at the entry node, executes each node's action, applies state mutations, and follows edges to the next node.

Key properties:

- **State is a signed knowledge item** persisted after each step. This means graphs are resumable and auditable — every intermediate state is saved.
- **Graph runs register in the thread registry** for status tracking, just like thread-based orchestration.
- **Nodes are action dicts** — `{primary, item_type, item_id, params}` — the same action format used everywhere else in Rye.
- **Edges use `condition_evaluator`** for conditional routing. Edges are evaluated in order; first match wins.

## Graph Definition Format

A graph tool YAML has the same structure as any Rye tool — `config_schema` for input validation, plus `config` for the graph definition:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
tool_type: graph
executor_id: rye/core/runtimes/state-graph/runtime
category: workflows/example
description: "Example graph tool"

config_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    directory:
      type: string
      default: "."

config:
  start: first_node # Entry node
  max_steps: 10 # Safety limit — prevents infinite loops

  nodes:
    first_node:
      action: # Action dict — same format as everywhere in Rye
        primary: execute
        item_type: tool
        item_id: rye/bash
        params:
          command: "echo hello"
      assign: # State mutations — write action results into state
        greeting: "${result.stdout}"
      next: second_node # Unconditional edge — string

    second_node:
      action:
        primary: execute
        item_type: tool
        item_id: rye/bash
        params:
          command: "echo ${state.greeting}"
      next: # Conditional edges — list of {to, when}
        - to: happy_path
          when:
            path: "state.greeting"
            op: "contains"
            value: "hello"
        - to: fallback # Last entry without `when` acts as default

    happy_path:
      type: return # Terminates the graph and returns state

    fallback:
      type: return
```

### Node Types

| Type        | Behavior                                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(default)_ | Execute `action`, apply `assign`, follow `next`          |
| `return`    | Terminate the graph and return current state             |
| `foreach`   | Iterate over a collection, executing the action per item |

### Foreach Nodes

Foreach nodes iterate over a list in state, executing an action for each item:

```yaml
fan_out:
  type: foreach
  over: "${state.tasks}" # Expression resolving to a list
  as: task # Variable name for current item
  parallel: true # Dispatch iterations concurrently
  action: # Action to execute per item
    primary: execute
    item_type: tool
    item_id: rye/agent/threads/thread_directive
    params:
      directive_name: my/directive
      inputs:
        text: "${task.text}"
        output_path: "${task.output_path}"
  collect: results # Optional — collect return values into state
  next: process_results
```

- **`over`** — Expression resolving to a list (e.g., `${state.items}`)
- **`as`** — Variable name bound to each item during iteration
- **`action`** — Standard action dict executed per item
- **`collect`** — Optional state key to store collected results as a list
- **`parallel`** — When `parallel: true` is set at the node level, iterations dispatch concurrently via `asyncio.gather`

Items in `over` can be dicts, enabling dotted access: if `task` is `{text: "...", path: "..."}`, then `${task.text}` resolves correctly.

### Edge Formats

| Format               | Example           | Behavior                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| String               | `next: done`      | Unconditional — always go to `done`      |
| List of `{to, when}` | See above         | Conditional — first matching `when` wins |
| Omitted              | _(no `next` key)_ | Implicit return — graph terminates       |

## How It Works (The Execution Chain)

State graphs follow the same execution chain pattern as any Rye tool:

```
graph tool YAML  →  state-graph/runtime  →  subprocess primitive
(nodes/edges)       (walks graph,              (runs the walker
                     dispatches rye_execute)     Python script)
```

This mirrors the standard tool chain — e.g., `my_tool.py → python/function → subprocess`. The runtime YAML uses an inline `-c` script that locates `walker.py` via `{runtime_lib}` (the anchor lib path).

The walker:

1. Loads the graph definition from the tool YAML
2. Initializes or resumes state
3. Loops: execute current node's action → apply assign → evaluate edges → move to next node
4. Persists state after each step
5. Terminates on `type: return`, missing `next`, or `max_steps` exceeded

## Interpolation

Graph templates use `${dotted.path}` syntax — System 3 from the templating docs.

### Available Namespaces

| Namespace     | Contents                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${state.*}`  | Current graph state (accumulated `assign` values)                      |
| `${inputs.*}` | Graph input parameters (from `config_schema`)                          |
| `${result.*}` | Output of the current node's action (available in `assign` and `next`) |

### Path Resolution

Dotted paths support both dict key lookups and numeric list indices:

```yaml
# Dict access
command: "echo ${state.greeting}"

# List index access
code: "${state.file_contents.0.stdout}" # First item's stdout
path: "${state.files.1.analysis_path}" # Second item's analysis_path

# Nested — list item is a dict
text: "${state.tasks.2.text}" # Third task's text field
```

### Fallback Chains

Use `||` to try multiple paths left-to-right. The first non-None value wins:

```yaml
params:
  directory: "${inputs.directory || state.directory}"
  api_key: "${inputs.api_key || state.api_key || state.default_key}"
```

This is useful when a value may come from graph inputs or from state accumulated in earlier nodes.

### Built-in Variables

Two built-in variables are available in all interpolation contexts — no namespace prefix needed:

| Variable         | Value                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `${_now}`        | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (e.g., `2026-03-02T12:00:00Z`) |
| `${_timestamp}`  | Unix epoch milliseconds (e.g., `1740912000000`)        |

```yaml
assign:
  started_at: "${_now}"
  run_id: "pipeline-${_timestamp}"
```

### None Warnings

When an expression resolves to `None`, the interpolation engine logs a warning with the full dotted path. This surfaces typos and missing state keys without silently producing `"None"` strings:

```
WARNING: Interpolation resolved to None: state.greting (did you mean state.greeting?)
```

### Consistent `inputs` Context

`inputs.x` works the same way in both `${...}` interpolation and gate `when` conditions. You do **not** need `state.inputs.x` in gates:

```yaml
# Both of these reference the same value:
params:
  dir: "${inputs.directory}"        # In interpolation
next:
  - to: custom_path
    when:
      path: "inputs.directory"      # In gate conditions
      op: "neq"
      value: "."
  - to: default_path
```

### Gate Execution Order

Within a node, `assign` runs **before** `next` is evaluated. This means gate conditions can reference values set in the current node's `assign` block:

```yaml
check_status:
  action:
    primary: execute
    item_type: tool
    item_id: rye/bash
    params:
      command: "curl -s ${state.health_url}"
  assign:
    healthy: "${result.exit_code}"
  next:
    - to: proceed
      when:
        path: "state.healthy"
        op: "eq"
        value: 0
    - to: retry
```

### Type Preservation

When `${path}` is the **entire expression** (the whole string value), the resolved type is preserved:

```yaml
assign:
  count: "${result.stdout}" # If stdout is an int, count is an int
  items: "${result.data}" # If data is a list, items is a list
```

When `${path}` appears **inside** a larger string, string conversion is used:

```yaml
params:
  command: "Found ${state.count} files" # Always a string
```

## Permissions

The graph walker enforces capabilities via `_check_permission()` — the same capability system used throughout Rye.

- **Empty capabilities = deny all.** The walker is fail-closed. If no capabilities are passed, every action is rejected.
- **Pass capabilities as parameters** when invoking the graph:

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="my-project/workflows/my_graph",
    parameters={
        "directory": ".",
        "capabilities": ["rye.execute.tool.*"],
        "depth": 5
    }
)
```

- **Capability format:** `rye.<primary>.<item_type>.<dotted.item.id>` with fnmatch wildcards

| Example                           | Grants                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `rye.execute.tool.*`              | Execute any tool                       |
| `rye.execute.tool.rye.bash`       | Execute only `rye/bash`           |
| `rye.load.knowledge.my-project.*` | Load any knowledge under `my-project/` |

## Result Unwrapping

When a node's action executes a tool, the raw result is an `ExecuteTool` envelope:

```json
{"status": "success", "type": "tool", "item_id": "rye/bash", "data": {"stdout": "42", "stderr": "", "exit_code": 0}, "chain": [...], "metadata": {...}}
```

The walker **unwraps** this envelope — it lifts `data` to the top level and drops envelope keys (`chain`, `metadata`, `path`, `source`, `resolved_env_keys`). After unwrapping:

```json
{ "stdout": "42", "stderr": "", "exit_code": 0 }
```

This is why `${result.stdout}` in `assign` expressions works naturally — you reference the inner data fields directly.

### Error Propagation

If the outer envelope has `status: "error"` **or** the inner data has `success: false`, the unwrapped result gets `status: "error"` injected. This ensures the walker's error handling (`on_error` edges, hooks, `error_mode`) fires correctly for tool failures like non-zero bash exit codes.

## State Persistence

State is saved as a knowledge item after each step:

- **Path:** `.ai/knowledge/graphs/<graph_id>/<run_id>.md`
- **Format:** YAML frontmatter (status, current_node, step_count, timestamps) + JSON body (full state)
- **Signed** after each write via the standard Rye signing mechanism

### Resume

To resume a failed or interrupted graph run, pass `resume_run_id`:

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="my-project/workflows/my_graph",
    parameters={
        "directory": ".",
        "resume_run_id": "my_graph-1739820456"
    }
)
```

The walker loads the persisted state and continues from the last saved node.

## Error Handling

### Graph-Level Error Policy

Set `on_error` in `config` to control the default behavior for all nodes:

| Policy                       | Behavior                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `on_error: "fail"` (default) | Stop the graph on the first error                |
| `on_error: "continue"`       | Skip `assign`, proceed to `next` edge evaluation |

### Node-Level Error Edges

Individual nodes can define `on_error: <node_name>` to route to a recovery node when the action fails. This takes priority over the graph-level policy:

```yaml
nodes:
  risky_step:
    action:
      primary: execute
      item_type: tool
      item_id: rye/bash
      params:
        command: "might-fail"
    on_error: handle_error # Route to recovery node on failure
    next: success_path # Normal path on success

  handle_error:
    action:
      primary: execute
      item_type: tool
      item_id: rye/bash
      params:
        command: "echo 'recovered'"
    assign:
      recovery_note: "Error was caught"
    next: success_path
```

When an error occurs, `state._last_error` is populated with `{node, error}` regardless of which error handling path is taken.

### Hook-Based Retry

`error` hooks can return a retry action:

```yaml
config:
  hooks:
    - event: error
      action:
        retry: true
        max_retries: 3
```

## Hooks

State graphs use the same hook infrastructure as directives.

### Supported Events

| Event             | Fires When                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `graph_started`   | Graph execution begins                               |
| `after_step`      | A node completes (action + assign + edge evaluation) |
| `error`           | A node action fails                                  |
| `limit`           | `max_steps` reached                                  |
| `graph_completed` | Graph terminates (via `return` node or final edge)   |

### Declaration

Hooks are declared in `config.hooks` as a list of `{event, condition, action}` objects:

```yaml
config:
  hooks:
    - event: after_step
      condition:
        path: "state.step_count"
        operator: "gte"
        value: 5
      action:
        primary: execute
        item_type: tool
        item_id: rye/bash
        params:
          command: "echo 'Reached step 5'"
```

## Example: Project Stats

A complete graph that counts Python files, counts total lines, and returns the results:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
tool_type: graph
executor_id: rye/core/runtimes/state-graph/runtime
category: workflows/test
description: "Gather project stats: count Python files, count total lines, produce summary"

config_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    directory:
      type: string
      default: "."

config:
  start: count_files
  max_steps: 10

  nodes:
    count_files:
      action:
        primary: execute
        item_type: tool
        item_id: rye/bash
        params:
          command: "find ${inputs.directory} -name '*.py' -not -path '*/.venv/*' | wc -l"
      assign:
        file_count: "${result.stdout}"
      next: count_lines

    count_lines:
      action:
        primary: execute
        item_type: tool
        item_id: rye/bash
        params:
          command: "find ${inputs.directory} -name '*.py' -not -path '*/.venv/*' -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null | wc -l"
      assign:
        line_count: "${result.stdout}"
      next: done

    done:
      type: return
```

Run it:

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="my-project/workflows/project_stats",
    parameters={
        "directory": ".",
        "capabilities": ["rye.execute.tool.rye.bash"],
        "depth": 5
    }
)
```

Result: `{"file_count": "42", "line_count": "1337", "_status": "completed"}`.

## State Graphs vs Thread Orchestration

|                 | State Graphs                                             | Thread Orchestration                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Flow**        | Deterministic — edges defined in YAML                    | LLM-driven — model reasons about next step             |
| **Best for**    | Data-driven pipelines where the flow is known in advance | Workflows that need reasoning, judgment, or adaptation |
| **Cost**        | Minimal — no LLM calls for routing                       | Higher — LLM calls at every step                       |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed graph structure                                    | Fully dynamic — model can change course                |
| **Debugging**   | Read the YAML, follow the edges                          | Read the transcript                                    |

**Combining them:** Graph nodes can spawn directive threads (via `execute directive`) for steps that need LLM reasoning. Use graphs for the deterministic scaffold and threads for the intelligent steps.

## Async Graph Execution

Graphs support `async: true` — same pattern as `execute directive`. The caller returns immediately with a `graph_run_id` while the graph runs in the background.

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="my-project/workflows/my_graph",
    parameters={
        "directory": ".",
        "async": True,
        "capabilities": ["rye.execute.tool.*"],
        "depth": 5
    }
)
# Returns immediately:
# {"success": true, "graph_run_id": "my_graph-1739820456", "status": "running", "pid": 12345}
```

The background process:

- Detaches a background process that runs independently of the caller
- Runs the graph to completion, updating the thread registry
- Writes stderr to `.ai/agent/threads/<graph_run_id>/async.log` for debugging
- Emits events to `.ai/agent/threads/<graph_run_id>/transcript.jsonl` (JSONL event log)
- Re-renders `.ai/knowledge/agent/threads/<graph_id>/<graph_run_id>.md` (signed knowledge markdown) at each step
- Updates registry status to `completed` or `error` on finish

Monitor progress three ways:

```bash
# 1. Raw event stream
tail -f .ai/agent/threads/<graph_run_id>/transcript.jsonl

# 2. Visual state + history (re-rendered at each step)
cat .ai/knowledge/agent/threads/<graph_id>/<graph_run_id>.md

# 3. Registry query
rye_execute(item_type="tool", item_id="rye/agent/threads/orchestrator",
            parameters={"operation": "list_active"})
```

## Single-Node Execution

Execute a single node from a graph with optional injected state — useful for debugging failures without re-running the entire pipeline.

Pass `node` in parameters to target a specific node:

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="my-project/workflows/scraper_pipeline",
    parameters={
        "node": "store_results",
        "inject_state": {"scraped_data": [...], "results": [...]},
        "capabilities": ["rye.execute.tool.*"],
    }
)
# Returns: {"success": true, "state": {...}, "executed_node": "store_results", "next_node": "finalize", "step_count": 1}
```

Combined with resume — re-run a failed node from its checkpoint:

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="my-project/workflows/scraper_pipeline",
    parameters={
        "node": "store_results",
        "resume": True,
        "graph_run_id": "scraper-pipeline-1709000000",
        "capabilities": ["rye.execute.tool.*"],
    }
)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `node` | string | Target node to execute (must exist in graph) |
| `inject_state` | dict | State overlay merged after init/resume |
| `resume` + `graph_run_id` | bool + string | Load state from a previous run's checkpoint |

Single-step runs use a `-step` suffixed run ID to avoid corrupting real transcripts.

## Static Validation

Validate graph structure without executing it:

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="my-project/workflows/scraper_pipeline",
    parameters={"validate": True}
)
# Returns: {"success": true, "errors": [], "warnings": ["unreachable nodes: orphan_node"], "node_count": 8}
```

The validator checks:

| Check | Type |
|-------|------|
| All `next:` targets reference existing nodes | Error |
| All `on_error:` targets reference existing nodes | Error |
| `start` node exists | Error |
| `permissions` declared | Error |
| Foreach `over:` expression present | Error |
| Foreach has `action` | Error |
| Deprecated `action.params.async` or `action.async` on foreach | Error |
| Unreachable nodes (BFS from start) | Warning |
| State keys referenced (`${state.x}`) but never assigned | Warning |
| State keys assigned but never referenced downstream | Warning |

## Environment Pre-Validation

Declare required environment variables at the graph or node level. The walker checks all of them before execution starts.

```yaml
# Graph-level (checked before any node runs)
env_requires:
  - BACKEND_API_URL
  - DATABASE_URL

config:
  nodes:
    store_results:
      env_requires:
        - BACKEND_API_URL  # Can also be per-node
      action:
        primary: execute
        item_type: tool
        item_id: my/backend-client
        params:
          endpoint: "/api/results"
```

If any required env var is missing, execution fails immediately with a descriptive error — not 6 nodes deep when the tool finally tries to connect.

## Observability

Graph execution produces a two-stream observability output — the same architecture used by thread transcripts, minus SSE streaming (graphs don't produce tokens, they emit discrete step events).

### Streaming Progress (stderr)

During execution, the walker prints one-line progress messages to stderr:

```
[graph:scraper_pipeline] step 1/8 discover_games ✓ 2.3s
[graph:scraper_pipeline] step 2/8 batch_scrape ✓ 8.1s (foreach)
[graph:scraper_pipeline] step 3/8 analyze_brainrot ✓ 1.2s (+brainrot_results)
[graph:scraper_pipeline] step 4/8 calculate_revenue ✓ 0.9s (+revenue_results)
[graph:scraper_pipeline] step 5/8 store_results ✗ 0.3s (connection refused)
```

- **Enabled by default.** Set `RYE_GRAPH_QUIET=1` to suppress.
- Shows step number, node name, status icon (✓/✗/⏹), elapsed time, and detail.
- **State diff:** when a step adds new state keys, they appear as `+key1, key2`.
- Foreach nodes show elapsed time and "foreach" detail.
- Gate nodes show "gate" detail.
- Never writes to stdout (walker returns JSON on stdout).

### JSONL Event Log

**Path:** `{project}/.ai/agent/threads/{graph_run_id}/transcript.jsonl`

An append-only log of graph lifecycle events. Each line is a JSON object:

```json
{"timestamp": "2026-02-23T10:00:01.234Z", "graph_run_id": "my_graph-1739820456", "event_type": "step_completed", "payload": {"node": "count_files", "step": 1}}
```

**Event types:**

| Event                | Fires When                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `graph_started`      | Graph execution begins                        |
| `step_started`       | A node begins execution                       |
| `step_completed`     | A node completes (action + assign + edges)    |
| `foreach_completed`  | A foreach node finishes all iterations        |
| `graph_completed`    | Graph terminates normally                     |
| `graph_error`        | Graph terminates due to an error              |
| `graph_cancelled`    | Graph is cancelled externally                 |

The log is checkpoint-signed at step boundaries via `TranscriptSigner` — each step boundary appends a signature event, making the log tamper-evident.

### Knowledge Markdown

**Path:** `{project}/.ai/knowledge/agent/threads/{graph_id}/{graph_run_id}.md`

A signed knowledge markdown file re-rendered from the JSONL log at each step. It contains:

- **Node status table** — visual overview of all nodes with status indicators: ✅ completed, 🔄 running, ⏳ pending, ❌ errored
- **Event history** — chronological list of events from the JSONL log

The file is signed via `MetadataManager.create_signature` after each re-render.

> **Note:** This is separate from the state persistence file at `.ai/knowledge/graphs/<graph_id>/<run_id>.md`, which stores the JSON state for resume. The knowledge markdown is a human-readable observability artifact.

### Monitoring Workflow

**Raw event stream** — watch events as they happen:

```bash
tail -f .ai/agent/threads/<graph_run_id>/transcript.jsonl
```

**Visual state + history** — human-readable snapshot (re-rendered at each step):

```bash
cat .ai/knowledge/agent/threads/<graph_id>/<graph_run_id>.md
```

**Find running graphs** — query the orchestrator:

```python
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="rye/agent/threads/orchestrator",
    parameters={"operation": "list_active"}
)
```

**Process management** — check status, cancel, and list via dedicated tools:

```python
# Check if a specific graph run is alive
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="rye/core/processes/status",
    parameters={"run_id": "<graph_run_id>"}
)
# Returns: {"alive": true, "pid": 12345, "status": "running", ...}

# Cancel a running graph (SIGTERM → clean CAS shutdown + state persistence)
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="rye/core/processes/cancel",
    parameters={"run_id": "<graph_run_id>"}
)

# List all active processes
rye_execute(
    item_type="tool",
    item_id="rye/core/processes/list",
    parameters={}
)
```

Cancellation is signal-based: the walker registers a SIGTERM handler that sets a shutdown flag. Between steps, the flag is checked and triggers clean shutdown — CAS state is persisted as "cancelled", the registry is updated, and a `graph_cancelled` transcript event is written with the signal number. This means a cancelled graph can always be resumed from its last completed step.

### Cross-Process Wait

When one graph waits for another (e.g., a foreach node with `parallel: true` iterations):

- **In-process waits** use `asyncio.Event` — zero polling, the event is set when the child completes
- **Cross-process waits** poll the thread registry at a flat **500ms** interval until the target reaches a terminal status

## CLI Operations

State-graph operations are available from the terminal via `ryeos-cli`:

```bash
# Run a graph end-to-end
rye graph run my-project/graphs/scraper_pipeline

# Run with input parameters
echo '{"min_ccu": 50000}' | rye graph run my-project/graphs/scraper_pipeline

# Run in background (returns run ID immediately)
rye graph run my-project/graphs/scraper_pipeline --async

# Execute a single node (for debugging failures)
rye graph step my-project/graphs/scraper_pipeline --node store_results

# Re-run a failed node from checkpoint
rye graph step my-project/graphs/scraper_pipeline \
  --node store_results \
  --resume-from scraper-pipeline-1709000000

# Inject state manually for testing
rye graph step my-project/graphs/scraper_pipeline \
  --node store_results \
  --state '{"scraped_data": [{"id": 1}]}'

# Static analysis without execution
rye graph validate my-project/graphs/scraper_pipeline
```

Install the CLI: `pip install ryeos-cli`. See the [CLI documentation](../future/ryeos-cli.md) for the full verb reference.

## CAS Persistence

Graph execution persists immutable snapshots to the [Content-Addressed Store](../internals/cas.md) after each run. These objects form a complete audit trail — every intermediate state, every node result, and every execution decision is recorded and dereferenceable by hash.

### Objects Produced

| Object | When Created | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ExecutionSnapshot` | After each graph run | Immutable checkpoint — links graph_run_id, manifest hashes, system_version, state_hash, and node_receipts[] |
| `NodeReceipt` | After each node | Audit record — `node_input_hash`, `node_result_hash`, `cache_hit`, `elapsed_ms`, `timestamp` |
| `NodeResult` | After each node | The full result dict stored as a CAS object, dereferenceable by hash |
| `StateSnapshot` | After each graph run | Graph state at completion, stored by hash |

### Refs

Mutable pointers at `.ai/objects/refs/graphs/<graph_run_id>.json` point to the latest `ExecutionSnapshot` hash for each run. Only refs are mutable — everything they point to is immutable.

### Retrace

Follow the chain to reconstruct any run:

```
ref → ExecutionSnapshot → node_receipts[] → NodeReceipt → NodeResult
                        → state_hash → StateSnapshot
```

Cross-run provenance: same `node_input_hash` across runs = same inputs.

## Node Caching

Nodes can opt into execution caching with `cache_result: true`. When enabled, the walker computes a deterministic cache key from the interpolated action, graph hash, lockfile hash, and config snapshot hash. If the cache key matches a previous execution, the cached result is used without re-execution.

```yaml
nodes:
  summarize:
    cache_result: true
    action:
      primary: execute
      item_type: tool
      item_id: rye/agent/threads/thread_directive
      params:
        directive: summarize
        context: "${state.document_text}"
    assign:
      summary: "${result.output}"
    next: store_results
```

Default is `false` — safe for nodes with side effects or time-sensitive actions. Caches invalidate automatically when any input changes (graph YAML, config files, upstream state). See [Node Execution Cache](../internals/node-cache.md) for the full cache key composition and invalidation rules.
