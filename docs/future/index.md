# Future Directions

Exploratory designs that build on Rye's existing architecture. These are not committed to a roadmap — they're written up to preserve the thinking and make it easy to pick up later.

| Idea | Summary |
| ---- | ------- |
| [Encrypted Shared Intelligence](encrypted-shared-intelligence.md) | Encrypt the entire `.ai/` intelligence layer — directives, tools, knowledge — with group keys so organizations can share a cryptographically-gated knowledge fabric |
| [Continuous Input Streams](continuous-input-streams.md) | Extend thread continuation to handle browser automation, live image flow, and high-volume data streams |
| [Dynamic Personality](dynamic-personality.md) | RAG-indexed personality corpus as an alternative to static personality documents |
| [Memory & Intent Resolution](memory-and-intent-resolution.md) | Shared thread memory, natural-language intent resolution, and predictive pre-fetching |
| [ryeos-cli](ryeos-cli.md) | Terminal-native natural-language interface to RYE — invoke directives, tools, and searches from the shell without an MCP client |
| [ryeos-http](ryeos-http.md) | HTTP server wrapper that maps REST endpoints to RYE's four primitives — deploy RYE as a remote service for bots and integrations |
