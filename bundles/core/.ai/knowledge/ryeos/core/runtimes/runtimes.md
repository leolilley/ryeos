# Runtimes

Runtimes are execution environments. Core provides generic tool helper
descriptors and the subprocess executor; standard provides directive, graph,
and knowledge runtime binaries.

## Tool Runtimes (Core Bundle)

### Python Function (`tool:ryeos/core/runtimes/python/function`)
Loads a Python module and calls its `execute(params, project_path)`.

- **Interpreter:** `.venv/bin/python3` → `RYE_PYTHON` → `python3`
- **Imports:** prepends runtime-derived bundle-local roots to `sys.path`
- **Async support:** Yes (auto-detects and wraps with `asyncio.run`)
- **Timeout:** 300s
- **Use case:** Structured Python tools with function entry point

### Python Script (`tool:ryeos/core/runtimes/python/script`)
Runs a Python script as `__main__`.

- **Command:** runtime launcher invokes `{tool_path}` as `__main__` with `--project-path {project_path}`
- **Same interpreter and bundle-local `sys.path` setup as function runtime**
- **Timeout:** 300s
- **Use case:** Self-contained Python scripts

Shell commands run through `tool:ryeos/core/subprocess/execute`, and
graph workflows run through `runtime:graph-runtime` in the standard bundle.

## Execution Config

All runtimes inherit defaults from `config:execution/execution`:

| Setting                  | Default  |
|--------------------------|----------|
| `timeout`                | 300s     |
| `max_steps`              | 100      |
| `max_concurrency`        | 10       |
| `cancellation_mode`      | graceful |
| `cancellation_grace_secs`| 5        |

Override at project level in `.ai/config/execution/execution.yaml`
or user level in `~/.ryeos/.ai/config/execution/execution.yaml`.

## The `@subprocess` Alias

When a tool declares `executor_id: "@subprocess"`, it resolves to
`tool:ryeos/core/subprocess/execute`. This is the terminal subprocess
spawner that actually forks and execs the configured command.

The chain looks like:
```
Tool action → @subprocess → subprocess/execute → fork + exec → result
```

## Runtime implementation ownership

Active interpolation, conditions, graph traversal, and resume behavior
live in Rust runtimes and engine crates.
