  The four identity layers in ryEOS: publisher trust, user key, node key,
  and vault key; what each signs and who owns each artifact.

# Identity Model

ryeOS has four distinct identity/trust layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Storage | Created by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Publisher trust | Verify signed bundle items | `<user>/.ai/config/keys/trusted/<fp>.toml` | `ryeos init` / `ryeos trust pin` |
| User (CLI) key | Sign local CLI HTTP requests | `<user>/.ai/config/keys/signing/private_key.pem` | `ryeos init` |
| Node (daemon) key | Sign outbound daemon requests and authorized-key TOMLs | `<system>/.ai/node/identity/private_key.pem` | `ryeos init` |
| Vault X25519 | Seal/unseal vault secrets | `<system>/.ai/node/vault/private_key.pem` | `ryeos init`, repaired if missing after init |

## Publisher trust

`ryeos init` pins the compiled official publisher key and any
`--trust-file` entries. Additional publishers are pinned with
`ryeos trust pin`. Official publisher rotation requires a coordinated
binary release because the public key bytes are compiled into
`ryeos-node` and must hash to the compiled fingerprint.

## User (CLI) key

The user key is the operator identity for signing local daemon requests.
The CLI resolves it from `RYEOS_CLI_KEY_PATH` when set, otherwise from
`<user>/.ai/config/keys/signing/private_key.pem`. It must not fall back
to the node key.

## Node (daemon) key

The node key signs outbound remote requests, signs authorized-key TOMLs,
produces the node public identity document, and anchors the node
self-trust doc. Daemon startup never auto-regenerates it, because doing
so would invalidate user-space trust and remote authorizations.

Remote operations authorize the caller's node key, not the user's CLI key:

```text
CLI --[user key]--> local daemon --[node key]--> remote daemon
```

## Authorized keys

Authorized-key TOMLs are node-signed local node config. Bootstrap/admin
may grant wildcard `*`; normal remote delegation should enumerate scopes.
Daemon startup may repair the local user's authorized-key entry after
`ryeos init` has created the required keys and trust docs, but the daemon
never writes user trust.

## Vault X25519

Vault X25519 is separate from the Ed25519 node identity, so node-key
rotation does not brick sealed vault data. Vault rotation is handled by
vault rewrap flows.

## Request authentication

Local CLI requests are signed with the user key and verified against the
local authorized-keys store. Remote daemon-to-daemon requests are signed
with the caller node key and verified by the remote authorized-keys store.
