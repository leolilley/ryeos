description: 'Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID
  and returns matching libraries.


  You MUST call this function before ''query-docs'' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible
  library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format ''/org/project''
  or ''/org/project/version'' in their query.


  Selection Process:

  1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for

  2. Return the most relevant match based on:

  - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)

  - Description relevance to the query''s intent

  - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)

  - Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative)

  - Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)


  Response Format:

  - Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section

  - Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen

  - If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant
  one

  - If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements


  For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess
  match.


  IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find
  what you need after 3 calls, use the best result you have.'
