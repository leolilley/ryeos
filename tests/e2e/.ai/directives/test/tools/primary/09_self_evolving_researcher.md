# Self-Evolving Researcher

Self-evolution and research directive. Searches for existing knowledge, loads reference context, writes a research report, creates a new knowledge entry from its findings, signs it, and logs the evolution. The system learns from its own execution.

## Methodology
1. Searched existing knowledge base for entries related to '{input:research_topic}'
2. Loaded rye-architecture reference context
3. Synthesized findings into this report

## Existing Knowledge
- Search results for '{input:research_topic}' reviewed
- Reference context from rye-architecture loaded

## Findings
- Topic: {input:research_topic}
- Key insights synthesized from existing knowledge base
- Gaps identified for new knowledge creation

## Recommendations
- Create a new knowledge entry capturing learnings
- Sign the entry for validation
- Log the evolution for traceability

# Learnings: {input:research_topic}

## Summary
Knowledge entry auto-generated by the self-evolving researcher directive (test/09_self_evolving_researcher).

## Key Learnings
- Research conducted on topic: {input:research_topic}
- Existing knowledge base searched and reference context loaded
- Findings synthesized into research report at {input:workspace_dir}/research_report.md

## Source
- Directive: test/09_self_evolving_researcher v1.0.0
- Research report: {input:workspace_dir}/research_report.md

## Evolution Note
This entry was created autonomously by the research pipeline, demonstrating self-evolution — the system learning from its own execution and persisting knowledge for future use.

## Timestamp
Auto-generated by test/09_self_evolving_researcher

## Actions Taken
1. **Searched** knowledge base for '{input:research_topic}' — found existing entries
2. **Loaded** rye-architecture reference context
3. **Wrote** research report to {input:workspace_dir}/research_report.md
4. **Read** report to extract key learnings
5. **Created** knowledge entry at .ai/knowledge/{input:research_topic}-learnings.md
6. **Signed** knowledge entry {input:research_topic}-learnings
7. **Logged** this evolution record

## Knowledge Created
- ID: {input:research_topic}-learnings
- Type: learning
- Location: .ai/knowledge/{input:research_topic}-learnings.md

## Self-Evolution Result
The system has expanded its own knowledge base. Future queries about '{input:research_topic}' will find the newly created entry, enabling compounding intelligence.
