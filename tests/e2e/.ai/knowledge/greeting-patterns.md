# Greeting Patterns Reference

Common patterns for user greetings in applications.

## Formal Greetings

- "Good morning, {name}"
- "Dear {name},"
- "Welcome, {name}"

## Casual Greetings

- "Hey {name}!"
- "Hi there, {name}"
- "What's up, {name}?"

## Best Practices

1. **Personalization**: Always use the user's name when available
2. **Time awareness**: Adjust greeting based on time of day
3. **Context sensitivity**: Match formality to application context
