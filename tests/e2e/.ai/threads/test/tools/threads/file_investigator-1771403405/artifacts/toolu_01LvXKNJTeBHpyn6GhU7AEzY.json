The mystery file titled \"The Case of the Missing Code\" has been successfully created, reviewed, and analyzed.\n+An investigation was conducted into the theft of a precious ancient artifact from the museum's secure vault. A mystery file was created and analyzed to solve the case.\n \n ## Mystery File Contents\n+The mystery file contained a detailed case description with three investigative clues:\n \n-The mystery file contained a narrative about a senior software engineer who has gone missing from their company along with critical source code. The mystery presents three key clues for investigation:\n+1. **Clue 1:** The thief wore expensive designer shoes with red soles (distinctive luxury footwear marker)\n+2. **Clue 2:** A monogrammed handkerchief with initials \"VW\" was left at the scene\n+3. **Clue 3:** Museum records show Victor Westbrook previously attempted to purchase the artifact but was denied\n \n-### The Three Clues:\n-1. **Security Access**: Someone accessed the backup server at 2 AM on Saturday morning using credentials that hadn't been used in 3 months\n-2. **Physical Evidence**: A coffee cup with a cryptic note \"Trust no one in the office\" was discovered near the engineer's desk on Monday morning\n-3. **Sighting**: The engineer's car was spotted at the airport by a colleague at 3 AM on Saturday, though no flight records confirm they boarded any plane\n+## Directory Investigation\n+The investigation directory contains the following files:\n+- investigation/mystery.md (937 bytes)\n+- investigation/report.md (this file)\n \n-## Analysis of Clues\n+**Total files: 2**\n \n-- The unusual backup access suggests deliberate removal of digital evidence\n-- The cryptic note indicates the engineer was attempting to create a false narrative to misdirect investigators\n-- The airport sighting appears to be a decoy - the vehicle was intentionally placed there to throw off the investigation\n+## Analysis and Conclusion\n+After carefully analyzing all three clues, the investigation conclusively identifies **Victor Westbrook** as the culprit:\n \n-## Hidden Answer Revealed\n+- **Evidence Chain 1:** Victor Westbrook is a wealthy collector known for wearing expensive designer shoes with red soles\n+- **Evidence Chain 2:** The monogrammed handkerchief with initials \"VW\" directly corresponds to Victor Westbrook's initials\n+- **Evidence Chain 3:** Westbrook had clear motive, as he had previously attempted to acquire the artifact through legitimate means but was denied due to ethical concerns\n \n-The investigation uncovered that the engineer was working on a secret remote project for a competitor and deliberately staged their own disappearance. This was a coordinated effort to:\n-- Delete evidence via unauthorized backup access\n-- Create confusion with the threatening note\n-- Establish a false trail through the airport sighting\n+The convergence of all three clues (designer shoes, monogram match, and established motive) creates an irrefutable case against Victor Westbrook.\n \n-## Directory Status\n-\n-- **Files in investigation directory**: 2 (mystery.md and this report.md)\n-- **Investigation Status**: Complete\n-\n-## Conclusion\n-\n-The mystery was successfully created, investigated, and documented. The narrative demonstrates the value of analyzing multiple clues and considering alternative explanations before drawing conclusions.+## Recommendation\n+Victor Westbrook should be apprehended and questioned regarding his whereabouts at the time of the theft. The monogrammed handkerchief should be examined for fingerprints and additional forensic evidence.",
