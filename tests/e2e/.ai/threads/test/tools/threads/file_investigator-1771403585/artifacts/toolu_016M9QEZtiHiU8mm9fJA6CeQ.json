A priceless ancient artifact has disappeared from the museum's vault during the night, and three suspects had access to the building.\n[LID:a0fe63] \n[LID:08bc40] ## Clues Analysis\n[LID:ba805a] \n[LID:5de455] The mystery presents three clues:\n[LID:0b357a] \n[LID:db4dba] 1. **Muddy Footprints**: Footprints lead into the vault but not out, suggesting an alternative escape route.\n[LID:f2aa2d] \n[LID:494766] 2. **Security Camera Evidence**: A figure in a red jacket was captured on camera entering at 2:15 AM, and only the Head of Security wore a red jacket that night - a critical identifying factor.\n[LID:31b144] \n[LID:ff2939] 3. **Professional Tampering**: The vault's lock shows professional tampering, requiring advanced knowledge of 19th-century security systems - a skill set limited to specialized individuals.\n[LID:b87efa] \n[LID:9548ca] ## Solution\n[LID:1e0fc8] \n[LID:7c2f75] The investigation reveals that **the Head of Security is the thief**. This conclusion is supported by:\n[LID:44b281] - Possession of specialized knowledge to bypass the security system\n[LID:bd5a6f] - Being the only one wearing the red jacket visible on camera\n[LID:fbfce5] - Access to an underground tunnel for escape, explaining the absence of return footprints\n[LID:2c3baa] - Understanding of the vault's security mechanisms well enough to disable alarms\n[LID:6d807a] \n[LID:2e022f] ## Files in Investigation Directory\n[LID:d47c76] \n[LID:64dcb5] The investigation directory contains **2 files**:\n[LID:076c73] 1. mystery.md (the mystery case file)\n[LID:6bef70] 2. report.md (this investigation report)\n[LID:c77ab1] \n[LID:d5067f] ## Conclusion\n[LID:f3002c] \n[LID:556be2] The mystery has been successfully documented and investigated. The deliberate misdirection of the false footprints demonstrates that the thief possessed both technical expertise and tactical thinking.",
