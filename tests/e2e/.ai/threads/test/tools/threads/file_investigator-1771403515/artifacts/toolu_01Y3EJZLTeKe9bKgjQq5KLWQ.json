The theft wasn't discovered until 5:30 PM\u2014a 1 hour 43 minute window. This timing suggests inside knowledge of the security schedule.\n+**Clues Provided:**\n+1. The watch was last seen at 8:15 PM on the mahogany desk\n+2. A wet footprint was found leading from the French doors to the desk\n+3. The guest who wore expensive Italian leather shoes left early at 8:20 PM\n \n-### Clue 2: Muddy Footprint\n-A muddy footprint on the vault door frame matches the shoe size of the night shift janitor. However, the print's freshness and the timing of the theft are inconsistent with the janitor's normal schedule, suggesting this may be a planted clue.\n+## Analysis of Clues\n+- **Clue 1** establishes the timeline and location of the theft\n+- **Clue 2** provides physical evidence that appears to implicate someone with access to the French doors\n+- **Clue 3** identifies a suspicious guest but serves as a deliberate red herring\n \n-### Clue 3: Conflicting Alibis\n-The most critical clue: The museum director claims to have been having coffee with the head of security at the time of theft (3:47 PM), but the security head claims he was alone reviewing camera footage. This contradiction indicates at least one false alibi.\n+## The Solution\n+The answer revealed in the mystery file: **The butler is the culprit.** The butler exploited his knowledge of house keys and staff access to use the French doors. The wet footprint was indeed from rain, and the expensive Italian shoes of the departing guest were a deliberate misdirection. The butler wore rubber boots that left the wet impression.\n \n-## Investigation Conclusion\n-Based on the hidden answer provided in the mystery file: The head of security is the thief. He exploited his position and access during the guard change. The director was complicit in the crime, providing a false alibi. The muddy footprint was deliberately planted to mislead the investigation toward an innocent party (the janitor).\n+## Directory Contents\n+The investigation directory currently contains 1 file:\n+- investigation/mystery.md (the mystery file created)\n \n-## Files in Investigation Directory\n-- mystery.md (created)\n-- report.md (this file)\n-**Total Files: 2**\n-\n-## Final Assessment\n-This is a well-crafted mystery with a sophisticated plot involving insider knowledge and a red herring. The conflicting alibis and timeline inconsistencies are the key indicators of guilt.+## Conclusion\n+This was a well-crafted mystery that demonstrated how physical evidence (the footprint) and suspicious behavior (the guest leaving) can be used to frame an innocent party while the actual culprit exploits their trusted position.",
