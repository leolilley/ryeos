The theft wasn't discovered until 5:30 PM\u2014a 1 hour 43 minute window. This timing suggests inside knowledge of the security schedule.\n[LID:f2aa2d] \n[LID:2cab7c] ### Clue 2: Muddy Footprint\n[LID:21f327] A muddy footprint on the vault door frame matches the shoe size of the night shift janitor. However, the print's freshness and the timing of the theft are inconsistent with the janitor's normal schedule, suggesting this may be a planted clue.\n[LID:058be7] \n[LID:d0e708] ### Clue 3: Conflicting Alibis\n[LID:9b6d51] The most critical clue: The museum director claims to have been having coffee with the head of security at the time of theft (3:47 PM), but the security head claims he was alone reviewing camera footage. This contradiction indicates at least one false alibi.\n[LID:1e0fc8] \n[LID:7e91ad] ## Investigation Conclusion\n[LID:994ed8] Based on the hidden answer provided in the mystery file: The head of security is the thief. He exploited his position and access during the guard change. The director was complicit in the crime, providing a false alibi. The muddy footprint was deliberately planted to mislead the investigation toward an innocent party (the janitor).\n[LID:1de703] \n[LID:9a5a3d] ## Files in Investigation Directory\n[LID:d0640d] - mystery.md (created)\n[LID:f74780] - report.md (this file)\n[LID:2f4348] **Total Files: 2**\n[LID:d47c76] \n[LID:2daf20] ## Final Assessment\n[LID:3e574f] This is a well-crafted mystery with a sophisticated plot involving insider knowledge and a red herring. The conflicting alibis and timeline inconsistencies are the key indicators of guilt.",
