The mystery file titled \"The Case of the Missing Code\" has been successfully created, reviewed, and analyzed.\n \n ## Mystery File Contents\n \n-The mystery file titled \"The Case of the Missing Prototype\" contains an intriguing theft investigation narrative:\n+The mystery file contained a narrative about a senior software engineer who has gone missing from their company along with critical source code. The mystery presents three key clues for investigation:\n \n-**Scenario:** A revolutionary new device has vanished from a research lab.\n+### The Three Clues:\n+1. **Security Access**: Someone accessed the backup server at 2 AM on Saturday morning using credentials that hadn't been used in 3 months\n+2. **Physical Evidence**: A coffee cup with a cryptic note \"Trust no one in the office\" was discovered near the engineer's desk on Monday morning\n+3. **Sighting**: The engineer's car was spotted at the airport by a colleague at 3 AM on Saturday, though no flight records confirm they boarded any plane\n \n-### Clues Found\n+## Analysis of Clues\n \n-1. **Physical Evidence:** The thief wore expensive Italian leather shoes, leaving a distinctive mark on the lab floor near the secure cabinet.\n-2. **Temporal Evidence:** A coffee cup from the exclusive downtown caf\u00e9 \"Brew & Co.\" was found on the researcher's desk, with a timestamp showing 11:47 PM.\n-3. **Visual Evidence:** Security footage shows someone wearing a lab coat with an unusual purple patch on the shoulder entering through the east entrance.\n+- The unusual backup access suggests deliberate removal of digital evidence\n+- The cryptic note indicates the engineer was attempting to create a false narrative to misdirect investigators\n+- The airport sighting appears to be a decoy - the vehicle was intentionally placed there to throw off the investigation\n \n-### Investigation Analysis\n+## Hidden Answer Revealed\n \n-The three clues work in conjunction to create a compelling case:\n+The investigation uncovered that the engineer was working on a secret remote project for a competitor and deliberately staged their own disappearance. This was a coordinated effort to:\n+- Delete evidence via unauthorized backup access\n+- Create confusion with the threatening note\n+- Establish a false trail through the airport sighting\n \n-- **The Italian Leather Shoes** suggest someone with refined taste and financial means\n-- **The Brew & Co. Coffee Cup** indicates the person has a specific preference and frequent habits\n-- **The Lab Coat with Purple Patch** proves the suspect had access to the lab and wore distinctive clothing\n+## Directory Status\n \n-### Solution\n-\n-The investigation reveals that **Dr. Elena Martinez**, the night shift supervisor, was the culprit. She needed the prototype to complete a competing research project. The evidence converges on her through:\n-- Her known preference for Brew & Co. coffee\n-- Her custom-made Italian shoes\n-- The purple patch on her lab coat (a gift from her sister in the textile department)\n-\n-## Directory Findings\n-\n-The investigation directory now contains at least 2 files:\n-- `investigation/mystery.md` - The original mystery file\n-- `investigation/report.md` - This investigation report\n+- **Files in investigation directory**: 2 (mystery.md and this report.md)\n+- **Investigation Status**: Complete\n \n ## Conclusion\n \n-The case has been successfully analyzed. The combination of evidence types (physical, temporal, and visual) provides a complete and convincing solution to the mystery.+The mystery was successfully created, investigated, and documented. The narrative demonstrates the value of analyzing multiple clues and considering alternative explanations before drawing conclusions.",
