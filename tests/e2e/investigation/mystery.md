# The Case of the Missing Artifact

A priceless ancient artifact has disappeared from the museum's vault during the night. Three suspects had access to the building, and each left behind a clue.

## Clues

* **Clue 1:** Muddy footprints were found leading from the East Wing corridor to the main vault, but there are no footprints returning from the vault.

* **Clue 2:** The security camera footage shows a figure in a red jacket entering at 2:15 AM, but the museum staff records indicate that only the Head of Security was wearing a red jacket that night.

* **Clue 3:** The vault's lock mechanism shows signs of professional tampering, and only someone with advanced knowledge of 19th-century security systems would know how to disable it without triggering alarms.

## Hidden Answer

The thief was the Head of Security. They had the knowledge to bypass the security system, wore the red jacket that appeared on camera, and were clever enough to stage false footprints leading into the vault while escaping through an underground tunnel that exits outside the building perimeter.
