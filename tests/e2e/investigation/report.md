# Investigation Report

## Summary

An investigation has been conducted into the mystery file stored in the investigation directory.

## Mystery File Contents

The mystery file titled **"The Case of the Missing Artifact"** details a museum heist scenario. A priceless ancient artifact has disappeared from the museum's vault during the night, and three suspects had access to the building.

## Clues Analysis

The mystery presents three clues:

1. **Muddy Footprints**: Footprints lead into the vault but not out, suggesting an alternative escape route.

2. **Security Camera Evidence**: A figure in a red jacket was captured on camera entering at 2:15 AM, and only the Head of Security wore a red jacket that night - a critical identifying factor.

3. **Professional Tampering**: The vault's lock shows professional tampering, requiring advanced knowledge of 19th-century security systems - a skill set limited to specialized individuals.

## Solution

The investigation reveals that **the Head of Security is the thief**. This conclusion is supported by:
- Possession of specialized knowledge to bypass the security system
- Being the only one wearing the red jacket visible on camera
- Access to an underground tunnel for escape, explaining the absence of return footprints
- Understanding of the vault's security mechanisms well enough to disable alarms

## Files in Investigation Directory

The investigation directory contains **2 files**:
1. mystery.md (the mystery case file)
2. report.md (this investigation report)

## Conclusion

The mystery has been successfully documented and investigated. The deliberate misdirection of the false footprints demonstrates that the thief possessed both technical expertise and tactical thinking.
